# Snake-AI
AI tries to play the SNAKE-Game making use of Reinforcement learning and Deep Neural Network

Reinforcement learning in brief: ```Reinforcement learning is a machine learning training method based on rewarding desired behaviors and/or punishing undesired ones. In general, a reinforcement learning agent is able to perceive and interpret its environment, take actions and learn through trial and error.```
